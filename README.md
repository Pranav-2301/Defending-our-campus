# Defending The Campus: Evaluating Phishing Awareness and Susceptibility Factors Amongst University Students and Admin

## Abstract
This research paper presents a **detailed investigation** into the awareness and susceptibility of university students to phishing attacks, emphasizing the critical and growing concern in cybersecurity. The vulnerability of this young demographic to sophisticated cyber threats is underscored, with a focus on assessing their current level of understanding, awareness, and ability to recognize phishing attempts.

## Introduction
Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as digital technologies integrate more into our daily routine. This study aims to determine how aware and well-equipped university students are against sophisticated cyber threats. The main research questions include:
- How well-informed are university students today about phishing?
- What are the variables influencing college students' susceptibility to phishing attacks?
- How likely are students to recognize and react to phishing attempts?

## Methodology
Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach including a **detailed survey methodology** through NYU Qualtrics to assess phishing awareness among students. Challenges such as recruitment and data confidentiality were addressed with strategic follow-ups.

## Key Findings
- **Education Level:** There's a direct correlation between the education level and the ability to recognize phishing scams.
- **Professional Experience:** Professional experience, especially in IT or cybersecurity, significantly enhances one's ability to identify phishing attempts.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The pandemic's stress levels correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging with phishing attempts.
