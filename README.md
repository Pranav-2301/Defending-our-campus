The purpose is to investigate and understand the awareness
levels and the human behavioral factors which make the
university students susceptible to phishing attacks. Phishing
attacks are deceptive and the most common cyber threat
which makes it essential to assess how well-informed and
prepared students are. The goal is to identify factors
involving which directly or indirectly affect students’
susceptibility to phishing attacks.
Detailed Plan of Approach
This study is focused to comprehensively investigate and
enhance phishing awareness among university students
across diverse backgrounds. Phishing remains a pervasive
cybersecurity threat. Understanding factors which influence
susceptibility is a critical task for effective mitigation
strategies. We will target university students from various
age groups, majors, professional backgrounds and
ethnicities. Participants will be from diverse academic
majors which ensures a representative sample. Data will be
collected through an online survey which will be hosted on
NYU qualtrics to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.
Participants will be invited through vocal and social media
channels to maximize the reach. Survey will include a
series of questions which are designed to assess
cybersecurity awareness, prior experiences with phishing
attacks and factors such as workload, stress, post
COVID-19 anxiety, immigration status or any underlying
medical conditions. Prior participation and while
participating, participants will be presented with a
disclaimer clearly stating that participation in the study is
voluntary. It will outline the purpose of the study, data
handling procedure and participant’s rights. It will
emphasize that participants have the opportunity to review
the information provided and ask questions before
proceeding. This will ensure the informed voluntary
participation and rights within the survey context itself,
which maintains transparency. Survey will consist of
questions which will be organized into following sections :
General Cybersecurity Awareness, Personal and
Demographic Information, Susceptibility Factors and
Perceptions of Phishing Attacks. Survey responses will be
anonymized and aggregated for analysis. Quantitative data
will be analyzed using Qualtrics statistical tools to identify
trends and patterns. Qualitative data from open-ended
questions will undergo thematic analysis to uncover
nuanced insights.
